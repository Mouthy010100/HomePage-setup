# HomePage-setup
This setup gives you widgets for a stockmarket app and jellyfin and jellyseer widgets. It also includes a search provider and icon for your homepage and a friendly little greeting which you can change to whatever you like. I used docker-compose for this setup but if you would like to do this differently check out The official Homepage website for moren https://gethomepage.dev/en/installation/
